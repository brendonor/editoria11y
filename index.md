# Editoria11y

Editoria11y (editorial [ally](https://www.a11yproject.com/)) is a user-friendly accessibility "auto-correct" checker that addresses three critical needs for content authors:

1. It runs automatically. Modern spellcheck works so well because it is always running; put spellcheck behind a button and few users remember to run it!
1. It focuses exclusively on straightforward issues a content author can easily understand and easily fix. Yes; comprehensive testing should be a key part of site creation, but if a tool is going to run automatically on every page, it will do more harm than good if it is alerting on issues editors cannot fix.
1. It runs in context. Modern content management systems often assemble pages from many separately-edited blocks, widgets and elements. Only a fully-assembled "page" can be checked for things like the header outline order.

### Recent changes
Major changes in version 2.x:
* Content editors can now hide (and restore) "manual check" alerts.
* When connected to a cloud API, "manual check" alerts can be marked as OK for all users, and results can be sent to a site-wide dashboard.
* Additional theme variations and the ability to insert custom colors.
* Tips extensively rewritten; external links to Princeton content removed.
* The checker can now scan within shadow components.
* Removing the jQuery dependency and rewriting tests doubled performance.

Editoria11y's JavaScript began as a fork of the [Sa11y](https://ryersondmp.github.io/sa11y/) library, which was created by Digital Media Projects, Computing and Communication Services (CCS) at Toronto Metropolitan University. The libraries share most tests, and our teams work together on new features.

Sa11y itself began as a fork of [Tota11y by Khan Academy](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y).
